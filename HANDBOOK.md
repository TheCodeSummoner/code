## Telepat North Handbook

### Recruitment and Onboarding
- Members can recommend persons they judge worthy of North membership.
  - Every quarter, several memberships will become available. This will be announced on the `#candidates` channel.
  - To submit a candidate, post a message on the `#candidates` channel with a short but powerful case in favor of that person.
- Candidates that choose to pursue membership will need to read the Code and have a 30-minute video call with the North crew.
- After candidates get their admission email, we'll:
  - ask them to thoroughly read this handbook
  - work with them on setting up their North profile
- As soon as the profile is set up, we'll introduce the new member to our Slack community.

### Commitments
- Members commit to honor the Code.
- Members must have high English proficiency, and be skilled enough to communicate with people from around the world.
- For every benefit members receive, they're expected to contribute the sum of their gained knowledge and experience back to the community.
  - Always post a message on the `#preach` channel, describing:
    - How the benefit made you better.
    - The most important lessons you've learned.
    - Recommendations for your peers based on your learnings.
  - Be present on the North Slack and ready to share knowledge with your peers that ask for help.
  - Apply learnings to North Research projects.
  - Read your peer's standups, and see if there are any blockers you can help out with or things you can recommend. Reach out personally and offer your support.
- Every three months each member has to deliver a personal standup, where they showcase their progress, improvements, and learnings.
  - You'll be expected to post a message on the `#standup` channel, describing:
    - Things you've done in the past three months to become better
    - Aspects you're planning to work on improving next
    - Things that feel like blockers for your growth
  - Emphasize your plan for growth, and how you're using the North community to implement it.
  - Emphasize what you've done to give back and distribute knowledge:
    - Contributions to open-source
    - StackOverflow activity
    - Volunteering
    - Teaching / Public speaking
    - Publishing
  - The first standup will be roughly three months after onboarding. We'll work out demo day dates for each member.
- Members need to contribute to at least one North Research project every year.
  - Research projects span 4 months and target producing work that improves technological practices and concepts.
  - You can choose one of the proposed topics or propose your own.
  - New project groups are created multiple times per year. Details on the proposed topics, proposing a topic and signing up for a specific topic will be posted on the `#research` channel.
  - A research group can have between four and seven members. As soon as a subject proposal gets four signups, it becomes active.
  - A dedicated channel will be created for each research project.
  - You can only be a member of a single research group at a time.
  - Conclusions, as well as possible research project artifacts, including papers, presentations, articles, datasets or code, will be presented to the community using the `#research` channel at the end of any project.
  - All research project artifacts and knowledge will be made freely available to the world. Any code will be open-sourced.
- Every six months each member checks in with the North crew for feedback and renewal.
  - You'll have a 30m video call with a group of the North crew.
  - We'll evaluate our process, brainstorm new ideas and see if we're still acting as a growth catalyst.

### Etiquette
Members should:
- Observe the `#code-updates` and `#handbook-updates` channels for important updates to document sources.
- Use `#overflow` to ask for technical support.
- Use `#random` for funny or personal messages.
- Use `#preach` to distribute knowledge. Any great professional content you want to share also belongs here.
- Use `#standup` for quarterly standups.
- Use `#research` for Research project talk.
- Use `#candidates` to check for openings and post cases for candidates.
- Use dedicated channels to request benefits, as laid out in this document.
- Use `#general` to post notifications and messages that don't fall into categories above to the entire community.
Members will refrain from posting advertisements or job opportunities to any channel.

### Benefits
- Members get a yearly North branded swag box.
  - The first box is sent out as soon as you're onboard Slack.
- Every three months, members receive a book of their choice.
  - Post a message to the `#books` channel, making the case for why the book you chose will make you become better professionally, and why you chose that book instead of others.
- Every six months, members receive access to an online course of their choice.
  - Post a message to the `#courses` channel, making the case for why the course you chose will make you become better professionally, and why you chose that course instead of others.
- Members can enroll in the Career Advancement Program
  - The program offers free career and personal marketability mentorship to get a feel for your alignment with the requirements of top tech companies.
  - You can enroll using your online profile.
- While we'd like to make even the most expensive learning materials available to every member, we're just not there yet. In rare cases, we might need to decline requests that we can't honor. We'll justify that decision each time.
- After finishing the course or book they received, or after deciding to drop it, members will post a message to `#preach` and share their learnings.
