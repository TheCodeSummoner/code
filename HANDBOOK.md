## Telepat North Handbook

### Recruitment and Onboarding
- Members can recommend persons they judge worthy of North membership.
  - Periodically, several North memberships will become available. This will be announced on the `#candidates` channel.
  - To submit a candidate, post a message on the `#candidates` channel with a short but powerful case in favor of that person.
- Candidates that choose to pursue membership will need to read the Code and have a 30-minute video call with the North crew.
- After candidates get their admission email, we'll:
  - ask them to thoroughly read this handbook
  - work with them on setting up their North 360 profile
- As soon as the profile is set up, we'll introduce the new member to our Slack community.

### Commitments
- Members commit to honor the Code.
- Members must have high English proficiency, and be skilled enough to efficiently communicate with people from around the world.
- For every received benefit, members are expected to contribute the sum of their gained knowledge and experience back to the community.
  - Always post a message on the `#preach` channel, describing:
    - How the benefit made you better.
    - The most important lessons you've learned.
    - Recommendations for your peers based on your learnings.
  - Be present on the North Slack and ready to share knowledge with your peers that ask for help.
  - Apply learnings to North Research projects.
  - Read your peer's standups, and see if there are any blockers you can help out with or things you can recommend. Reach out personally and offer your support.
- Every three months, each member has to deliver a personal standup to showcase their progress, improvements, and learnings.
  - You'll be expected to post a message on the `#standup` channel, describing:
    - Things you've done in the past three months to become better
    - Aspects you're planning to work on improving next
    - Things that feel like blockers for your growth
  - Emphasize your plan for growth, and how you're using the North community to implement it.
  - Emphasize what you've done to give back and distribute knowledge:
    - Contributions to open-source
    - StackOverflow activity
    - Volunteering
    - Teaching / Public speaking
    - Publishing
  - The first standup will be right after onboarding. We'll then work out standup dates for each member.
- Members should contribute to at least one North Research project every year.
  - Research projects span one month and target producing work that improves technological practices and concepts.
  - You can choose one of the proposed topics or propose your own.
  - New project groups are created multiple times per year. Details on the proposed topics, proposing a topic and signing up for a specific topic will be posted on the `#research` channel.
  - A research group can have between three and seven members. As soon as a subject proposal gets three signups, it becomes active.
  - A dedicated channel will be created for each research project.
  - You can only be a member of a single research group at a time.
  - Conclusions, as well as possible research project artifacts, including papers, presentations, articles, datasets or code, will be presented to the community using the `#research` channel at the end of any project.
  - All research project artifacts and knowledge will be made freely available to the world. Any code will be open-sourced.

### Etiquette
Members should:
- Observe the `#code-updates` and `#handbook-updates` channels for important updates to document sources.
- Use `#overflow` to ask for technical support.
- Use `#random` for funny or personal messages.
- Use `#preach` to distribute knowledge. Any great professional content you want to share also belongs here.
- Use `#standup` for quarterly standups.
- Use `#research` for research project talk.
- Use `#perks` to request your benefits.
- Use `#candidates` to check for openings and post cases for candidates.
- Use `#general` to post notifications and messages that don't fall into categories above to the entire community.

Members are expected to refrain from posting advertisements or job opportunities to any channel.

### Benefits
- Members receive a yearly North mystery box.
  - The first box is sent out as soon as you're onboarded.
  - Expect swag and funky smart products.
  - Suggestions for things to be included in the next box are always welcome.
- Every three months, members can receive a book of their choice.
  - Post a message to the `#perks` channel, making the case for why the book you chose will make you into a better professional.
- Every six months, members receive access to an online e-learning course of their choice.
  - Same rules as with books apply.
- Members can enroll in the Career Advancement Program
  - The program offers free career and personal marketability mentorship to get a feel for your alignment with the requirements of top tech companies.
- Members can also opt into a custom benefit package.
  - You can get free access to tools or subscriptions to services that will help you grow professionally.
  - All available benefit package options will be discussed during onboarding.
- While we'd like to make even the most expensive learning materials available to every member, we're just not there yet financially. In some cases, we might need to decline requests that we can't honor. We'll justify that decision each time.
- After finishing the course, book or any perk they received, or after deciding to quit it, members are expected to post a message to `#preach` and share their learnings and experience.
